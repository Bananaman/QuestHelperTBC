• Disable donation request.\
Bad news, everyone. Questhelper's dead.\
Blizzard just posted their new UI Add-On Development Policy at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/policy/ui.html. The important part is that I'm no longer allowed to ask for donations in-client. I know how much I got before I added the in-client reminder - it doesn't pay a significant fraction of the bills. And, as much as I like you guys, good intentions don't pay for my apartment.\
So that's it. I'm going to be finishing up and releasing v1.0, and I'll keep posting incremental database improvements every month or two. I do plan to keep QH functional, at least through the end of Wrath, and probably further. I've got one or two features in mind that I want to do for my own sake - a few achievements, mostly - but besides that (and the v1.0 release) that's pretty much all there's going to be.\
I would like to say: thanks to everyone who donated in the past. I enjoyed working on this quite a bit, and I always enjoyed seeing another donation come in - not just because of the money, but because it meant that people wanted to use QH and wanted to keep it going.\
Let Blizzard know if you don't like it, and if I can get an exception, I'll start everything right back up again :)\

• Update database.\
HEY ZORBA WHERE'S 1.0 YOU SAID IT WOULD BE OUT BY NOW YOU SUCK AND I HATE YOU\
Yeah, I'm sorry. I've been painfully busy. You have no idea how busy I've been. That said: 1.0.0 pre-pre-pre-alpha is sent out to a few good friends of mine to test. I'm hoping to get a pre-pre-alpha out for testing by the end of the week. There's a bunch of problems left, but most of them are reasonably easy to fix, just timeconsuming. Unfortunately, next week is pretty much 100% taken (thanks to GDC, look it up on Google if you're curious) so I'm not going to have a lot of time this month to polish it off.\
It's close. It's *really* close. I promise it's really close. I'm not just slacking here.\
But it'll be a little longer.\

• Fix the minimap issue for real. Argh.\
\
|cffffff00       Version 0.92 3/2/2009|r\
\
• There was never a bug with rotating-minimaps causing the routing arrow to point at the wrong place. This release is merely being done for fun. Hey look! Wasn't that fun!\
\
|cffffff00       Version 0.91 3/1/2009|r\
