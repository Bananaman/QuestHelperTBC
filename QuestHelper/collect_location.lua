local function BolusizeLocation(c, x, y, rc, rz)
  -- c, rc, and rz are all *signed* integers that fit within an 8-bit int.
  -- x and y are floating-point values. We're going to assume they're 5-digit, but we also want at least 3 digits of precision. (Note that 3 digits is a more than most sites use - most of them do 3 digits in terms of local map coordinates, but most maps are more than 1000 yards large, with the exception of some major cities.) That's 8 digits total, so we're gonna be spending 32 bits on this. Lua uses 64-bit float types, which have something like 53 digits of precision, so we've got plenty of accuracy for our 32 bits.
  -- Overall we're using a somewhat-weird 11 bytes on this. Meh.
  -- Also, any nil values are being turned into MIN_WHATEVER.
