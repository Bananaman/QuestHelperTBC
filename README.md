# QuestHelper for The Burning Crusade

This is a backport of QuestHelper v0.95 (early wrath), with all of its nice bugfixes and great performance improvements.

Backported for The Burning Crusade! (TBC 2.4.6)

It was the final, "stable" version before the author gave up development of QuestHelper, since Blizzard was introducing their own built-in "helper" instead.
